# DataWizard Guides

How-to and reference guides included in the Seed. Guides are operational references (how to do a thing, how a platform behaves); skills are triggered workflows (see `SKILLS.md`); protocols are the conventions that govern structure (see `Protocols/`).

## Platform and Environment Behaviors

The standing home for platform and environment gotchas - the things that trip an instance up because of how the runtime behaves (Cowork, the Obsidian MCP, the sandbox, scheduled tasks, the desktop config), as distinct from how the content or methodology works.

These learnings rot faster than any other kind because they have no design-doc home: content learnings self-plant into the relevant design doc, but platform gotchas have nowhere obvious to go and pile up in meta-learning reviews instead. This cluster is that home. When a meta-learning review surfaces a platform or environment learning, it lands here by default - extend the matching guide below, or add a new guide to the cluster if none fits (then list it here).

| Guide | Covers |
|---|---|
| **Cowork Scheduled Tasks** | Running DW automation as Cowork scheduled tasks: timezone/`fireAt`, one model per run, cron jitter, idempotency and the requirements for reliable unattended runs, runtime-URL limits. |
| **MCP Reliability and Write Verification** | Obsidian MCP failure modes (ghost writes, phantom/stale reads, frontmatter wipe), the write-verification protocol, concurrency practice, and sandbox/git gotchas. |
| **Editing the Claude Desktop Config** | Finding and safely editing `claude_desktop_config.json` to add MCP servers or grant folder access; JSON pitfalls and recovery. |

## Other Guides

### Git and sync
| Guide | Covers |
|---|---|
| **Git Guide** | Git for the vault and DW projects: repo setup, nested vs standalone repos, push workflows, DW Save, and the commit guard (conflict-marker + Windows-unsafe-filename pre-commit hook and CI). Sectioned - see `Git Guide/`. |
| **Seed Install and Update** | Installing the Seed into a vault and updating it via `update_seed.sh`. |

### Vault structure and content
| Guide | Covers |
|---|---|
| **Vault Structure Guide** | Folder conventions, meta-folder naming, and the shell + section architecture. |
| **Filename Safety** | Cross-platform-safe filenames: the character map and replacement rules. |
| **Federation Guide** | Sharing content across vaults and projects: the full-copies-only rule and the human-duplication workflow. |
| **Harvest Workflow Guide** | The harvest pipeline end to end: routing, provenance, and execution. |
| **Obsidian Bases Reference** | Using Obsidian Bases for DW dashboards and filtered views. |
| **Working Principles** | The reasoning behind the Working Rules - the "why" under the behavioral contract. |

### Onboarding and integrations
| Guide | Covers |
|---|---|
| **Human Onboarding Doc Template** | Template for generating a per-project human onboarding guide. |
| **Telegram Harvesting** | Harvesting Telegram exports into the vault; credentials stay outside git-tracked folders. |

### Maintainer notes
| Guide | Covers |
|---|---|
| **Obsidian MCP Improvement Requests** | Running log of desired Obsidian MCP fixes and features (a tracking doc, not a how-to). |

Archived guides keep an `xArchive -` filename prefix in `Guides/` and are left out of this catalog.
