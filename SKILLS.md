# DataWizard Skills

Portable skills included in the Seed. Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that load when triggered. For how-to and reference guides (including the Platform and Environment Behaviors cluster), see `GUIDES.md`.

For how skills work in DW's architecture, see the [Agent and Skills Architecture](https://github.com/andrewalan11/DataWizard) design docs in `Workshop/Design/`.

## Active Skills

| Skill | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **project-guidelines** (v1.4) | Technique | Creating or updating a project's 0.0 Project Guidelines file. Triggers on project setup, migration, or updating the project brief. Handles existing filename conventions gracefully. Includes `last_content_interests_review:` in new 0.0 templates. |
| **session-closer** (v4.3.0) | Technique | Writing the session log entry at the end of every session. Includes Learnings section and handoff-quality "What's next." The session log IS the handoff. Surfaces any pending-review report a scan has left waiting (health audit, meta-learning, Content Interests); it no longer computes staleness or nudges on thresholds -- detection and cadence live in the Review Automation guide. Insight-capture-aware knowledge transfer check. |
| **side-quest** (v1.0) | Technique | Tracking a tangent from the project's current arc as a parallel stream in the session log. Routes a side quest's continuation into "Active quest threads" and protects the main arc's "What's next" from being overwritten, so parallel streams don't collide under concurrency. Triggers on: "let's go on a side quest," "continue the [X] side quest." |
| **research-tracking** | Technique | Managing research to prevent duplicate work and make past evaluations findable. Tracks evaluations in a tracking index with inline verdicts for light items and links for deeper notes. Always load before starting research. |
| **tools-research** | Technique | Evaluating external tools, repos, frameworks, papers, or flagged content. Gathering-before-judging methodology with single-target, batch triage, and deep-read modes. Batch mode includes harvest pre-filtering and two-speed processing. References research-tracking. |
| **design-harvest** | Technique | Turning research findings into design doc updates, skill refinements, roadmap additions, and guideline improvements. The interpretive bridge between research (facts) and living docs (architecture). Includes target-section overlap check before planting. Completes the research lifecycle: tools-research (evaluate) -> research-tracking (track) -> design-harvest (integrate). |
| **insight-capture** (v1.0) | Technique | Capture and plant insights from loaded context mid-session. When rich context is loaded after deep work, side quests, or design discussions, synthesizes patterns, plants them in the right permanent homes (design docs, build plans, action items, skills, protocol, MOC, decision log), and cross-references for discoverability. Includes a protocol nudge for instances to offer at the right moment. Triggers on: "capture insights," "insight capture," "let's capture," "capture," "squeeze the juice." |
| **garden-synthesis** (v1.0) | Technique | Synthesizing a cluster of related seeds and seedpods into a coherent project concept -- a garden (taxonomy `type: garden`). Reads the seeds, synthesizes vision/model/offerings, researches allies across operator-configured knowledge layers, captures strategic insights (via insight-capture), and tags constituent seeds so membership is queryable vault-wide, with optional planter script and companion Base. Source locations resolve from `Vault Config.md`'s `## Garden Sources` block (git-ignored, per-operator), never hardcoded in a tracked Seed file. Triggers on: 'build a garden', 'synthesize a garden', 're-synthesize the [X] garden'. |
| **meta-learning-review** | Technique | Review accumulated session learnings and plant them into skills, design docs, and protocol. Complements design-harvest: design-harvest plants external research findings, meta-learning-review plants operational learnings from session history. Triggered on the session-closer threshold nudge or on demand. |
| **meta-learning-scan** (v1.2) | Technique | Automated scan of session log Learnings sections that produces a structured report for human review. Generates the report; meta-learning-review handles the planting. Use for scheduled meta-learning tasks or on demand before a review. |
| **content-interests-review** (v1.4) | Technique | Reviewing and updating a project's Content Interests section in its 0.0 Project Guidelines. Detects drift between what the 0.0 says and what the project is actually doing. Includes outsider readability and consolidation passes to ensure routing-agent-friendly output. Handles shell+sections session logs for mature projects, quest-aware for trajectory signals, and young-project guidance for speculative interests. Feeds the dynamic Vault Project Map. |
| **transcript-harvest** | Technique (stub) | Harvesting content from transcripts (video, podcast, meeting, voice memo) into project documents. |
| **document-harvest** | Technique (stub) | Harvesting content from articles, clippings, and web content into project documents. |
| **content-interest-scan** (v0.1, draft) | Technique | Scan material pools (_Clippings, Recall Vault, transcripts) against a project's 0.0 to surface unrouted content matching project interests. Three-pass scan (title, YAML, content). Two modes: per-project (default) and cross-project. Two scales: backlog (chunked, multi-session) and maintenance (nightly incremental). Depends on dw_ops.db. |
| **harvest-router** | Technique | Scanning the vault for unharvested content and routing it to the right projects. Moves files to correct content folders, sets routing YAML, appends action items. The upstream skill in the harvest pipeline -- it routes, transcript-harvest and document-harvest execute. |
| **block-stamper** (v1.0) | Technique | Stamp sequential block IDs (^bN for articles, ^tN for transcripts) on source file paragraphs, making them addressable for citations, harvest provenance, and RAG indexing. Run before enrichment or harvesting; called as a prerequisite by the enrichment and harvest skills. |
| **dw-intro** (v1.0) | Technique | Plain-language introduction to DataWizard: what it is, how the pieces fit together, the five essential practices (Project Instructions, orientation, session closer, DW Save, the approval model), and a skills overview. Called by install-wizard during setup. Also triggers standalone on: 'what is DataWizard?', 'what can DW do?', 'explain DataWizard', 'how does DataWizard work?', 'tell me about DataWizard'. |
| **install-wizard** (v1.3) | Technique | Interactive post-install setup for new DataWizard users. Picks up where the README left off: presents the dw-intro, verifies MCP connection (all tools), guides Project Instructions setup, explains git as the sync/collaboration layer, offers git onboarding. Triggers on: 'set up DataWizard', 'finish DataWizard setup', 'I just installed DataWizard'. |
| **project-health-audit** (v2.0) | Technique | Judgment-half audit of a DW project: consumes the dw_lint report for machine findings (filenames, YAML, sync, links, types), then checks infrastructure completeness (D84), MOC regeneration freshness (D92), shell narrative order, and routes findings. Tiered scopes (Quick/Standard/Full/Incremental); manual fallback for vaults without lint tooling. Triggered via 'DW review' or session-closer's threshold nudge. |
| **project-reconsolidation** (v1.2) | Technique | Periodic reconciliation audit that diffs every record of open work (action items, thread roster or ledger, quest log, dashboard) against recent session-log ground truth, classifies divergences (slipped / stalled / orphaned / done-but-open / contradiction / duplication / model-gap), and writes a reconsolidation report. The detection-and-repair complement to the structural Active Threads ledger (D105, D106); audits the tracking model, not just the data. Distinct from semantic divergence-convergence (framing drift). Triggers on 'run a reconsolidation pass', 'reconcile the open work', or a due tracking-health review. |
| **git-onboarding** | Technique | Walking a new collaborator through git setup for a vault or DW project. Gathers variables, guides through setup interactively, sets up DW Save (Cmd+Shift+S) with backup scheduling, and generates a project-specific onboarding guide. Uses the Git Guide (`Seed/Guides/Git Guide.md`) as reference. |

## Knowledge Lifecycle

The knowledge-focused skills form a lifecycle chain. Each covers a different source, timing, and scope, but they all route findings to the same destination types (design docs, skills, protocol, action items):

tools-research (evaluate external things) → research-tracking (prevent duplicate work) → design-harvest (plant research into design docs) → insight-capture (plant mid-session synthesis into permanent homes) → meta-learning-review (plant accumulated operational learnings) → session-closer Step 3.5 (verify everything transferred)

content-interest-scan and harvest-router feed the upstream end by surfacing unrouted content. content-interests-review keeps the routing signals current so the whole chain stays calibrated. S149.

**Protocol nudges** are lightweight behavioral triggers embedded at specific moments in the lifecycle. The three periodic reviews (health audit, meta-learning review, Content Interests) are no longer nudged by session-closer thresholds: scheduled automation detects staleness and produces a pending-review report, and session-closer Step 3.10 only surfaces a report already waiting -- see the Review Automation guide, where the cadence numbers now live (D114). insight-capture has its own nudge for instances to offer mid-session when rich context is loaded. These nudges are a pattern, not a separate skill: a brief conditional check at a decision point that surfaces the right thing at the right time. S149, S157, S250.

## Archived Skills

Retired skills live in the maintainer vault at `Workshop - DataWizard/xArchive - Skills/` (not shipped with the Seed). See there for superseded skill files and history.

## Workshop Skills (DW-Specific)

Skills that depend on DW infrastructure (tracking index, triage docs, two-vault architecture). Not portable to other projects. Live in `Workshop/Skills - DW Workshop/`.

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| **dw-research-workflow** | DW-specific research orchestration: Reddit triage campaigns, two-vault architecture, cross-project routing, git repo collection. Layers on tools-research + research-tracking + design-harvest. |
| **batch-triage** | Cluster-level triage with integrated design harvesting. Pre-filters items by harvest potential, runs two-speed evaluation (sweep for dismissals, harvest for design-relevant finds), updates all DW tracking infrastructure in one pass. Layers on tools-research + research-tracking + design-harvest. |

## Skill Format

Skills follow the SKILL.md standard: YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`, markdown body with instructions. Description says WHAT and WHEN (trigger conditions), never HOW (workflow). Body stays under 500 lines. Reference files go in the skill folder one level deep.

Three authoring notes from field use: (1) a skill that must work in two contexts -- called during a larger workflow vs invoked standalone -- can carry a "context-specific behavior" section with if-called-during / if-called-standalone rules, rather than duplicating content or splitting into two skills; (2) sequencing trap -- when skill A calls skill B at an early step, B executes before A's later calibration steps have run, so sequence sub-skill calls after the state they depend on (S223); (3) operator-specific paths -- a portable skill that needs vault-specific locations resolves them from a named block in `Vault Config.md` (git-ignored, per-operator), never from a tracked Seed file, which would both leak to other users and be clobbered on update. (S248)

See `Seed/Skills/project-guidelines/SKILL.md` for a well-structured example.
