# Project Guidelines Skill

## Overview

Creates or updates a project's 0.0 Project Guidelines file — the project brief that orients any incoming instance in one read. Covers 9 sections from project identity through Content Interests for routing agent integration.

## When to Use

- A new project needs a 0.0 file
- An existing 0.0 needs updating to current DW spec
- User says "update our 0.0" or "bring this project up to spec"
- A project migration is in progress
- Content Interests section needs writing or updating

### When NOT to Use

- Updating session logs, decision logs, or other 0.x files (those have their own formats)
- Writing project content (articles, design docs, shell files) — this skill is for infrastructure only
- Creating files in other projects' folders without being asked

## Before You Start

1. Read this skill fully
2. Read the project's existing 0.0 if one exists
3. Read the project's session log (last 3-4 entries), decision log, and action items
4. If no 0.0 exists, list the project's home folder to understand what's there

You need a full picture of the project before drafting.

## The 0.0 Sections

Adapt depth to project complexity. Lightweight projects need only 1, 2, 6, 7, 8. Aim for 800-1200 tokens — dense, scannable, cheap to read every thread.

**1. What This Project Is** (use this exact header: `## What This Project Is`) — one paragraph. Name, purpose, scope, stage. Self-contained — someone reading only this understands the project. The standardized header enables the dynamic Vault Project Map to embed this section via `![[0.0 Project Guidelines - ProjectName#What This Project Is]]`.

**2. Current state** — pointer only. "For what's active, read the session log and action items." Don't duplicate status — the 0.0 should be stable across sessions.

**3. Core concepts** — 3-6 ideas/patterns that shape how this project works. The mental model a new instance needs.

**4. Key architecture decisions** — one-liners pointing to decision log. Only the decisions that shape everything.

**5. Stack / instance config** — hardware, models, tools, paths. Label as instance-specific.

**6. Folder structure** — table: folder → purpose.

**7. Key pointers** — canonical docs, config files, repos, URLs. Name the project's **intake folders** here (where inbound feature requests, bug reports, skill requests, and handoffs from other projects land) so outbound items from other projects have a named target. The three-class file-placement rule (infrastructure / inbound / outbound-at-target-intake) lives in the Conventions Registry — point to it rather than restating it.

**8. Working conventions** — project-SPECIFIC rules only. Don't repeat universal protocol.

**9. Content Interests** (use this exact header: `## Content Interests`) — what a routing agent should flag for this project. "Flag if you see:" list. Be specific to the project's domain -- "local TTS models for podcast production" not "AI tools." The standardized header enables the dynamic Vault Project Map to embed this section. For detailed guidance on writing Content Interests, see the content-interests-review skill.

The framing varies: tech interests, narrative interests, connection interests, research interests. Whatever fits the project.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
title: Project Guidelines - [Project Name]
type: project-doc
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
datawizard_protocol_version: "[current]"
status: active
last_content_interests_review: YYYY-MM-DD  # set to created date if Content Interests written at creation
```

**Filename:** `0.0 Project Guidelines - [Project Name].md` — always include the `- ProjectName` suffix to avoid wikilink ambiguity across projects. The dynamic Vault Project Map depends on unique filenames for its embed references. If an existing 0.0 uses a different suffix than the project's folder name (e.g., an abbreviation or informal name), match the existing convention. Check other infrastructure files (0.2, action items) for the project's established naming pattern. Don't rename without asking.

## How to Draft

**Updating existing 0.0:** Show specific changes in chat. Don't reprint the whole document. Get approval, then write.

**Creating new 0.0:** Share your plan (which sections, rough content) in chat. Get approval, then write directly to vault.

## Common Mistakes

- **Duplicating status in section 2.** Every instance updates it, it drifts, now it contradicts the session log. Just point to the log.
- **Making it too long.** Over 1500 tokens means content belongs in other docs.
- **Including project history.** The 0.0 is "what is this now," not "how did it get here." Session log has the history.
- **Generic Content Interests.** "AI tools" doesn't help routing. "Obsidian plugins for YAML manipulation and bulk operations" does.
- **Copying universal protocol into section 8.** "Write to vault" is universal — don't repeat it here.
- **Empty placeholder sections.** If it doesn't apply, omit it.
- **Splitting a project prematurely.** When "should this be its own project?" arises, test against portability: if the work should ship with the Seed for any DW user, it belongs in DW regardless of the operational friction it causes for the builder. Intake/routing felt like a separate project (S123) but failed the portability test -- it's core DW functionality, not a standalone concern (D80, S124).

## Reference Implementation

Maintainer-vault example (not shipped with the Seed -- skip if absent): `_DataWizard/_Infrastructure - DataWizard/0.0 Project Guidelines - DataWizard.md`, a complex project's 0.0.
