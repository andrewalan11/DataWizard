# Transcript Harvest Skill

**Status:** STUB — full workflow to be written. For now, follow this sequence.

## Overview

Harvest content from transcripts (video, podcast, meeting, voice memo) into project-specific destination documents. Ensures segmentation, proper citation, and YAML state tracking.

## When to Use

- Processing a transcript that has been flagged for harvesting
- User says "harvest from this transcript" or "extract content from this recording"
- A transcript has `harvest_status: pending` or `harvest_for:` YAML fields set

### When NOT to Use

- Harvesting from articles, clippings, or non-transcript sources (use document-harvest)
- Researching external content (use research skill)
- Segmenting a transcript without harvesting (run `segment_transcript.py` directly)

## Workflow

1. **Check source YAML** — read `harvest_status`. If already `harvested`, confirm with user before re-harvesting.
2. **Check project assignment** — look for `harvest_for` in the transcript's YAML. If missing but the transcript has a `fathom_id`, look it up in `_DataWizard/Workshop/Fathom Meeting Index.md` and check the Project column. If the index has a project assignment, add `harvest_for` to the transcript's YAML before proceeding. If neither the YAML nor the index has a project, ask the user which project this transcript belongs to. Do not harvest without knowing the destination project.
3. **Check segmentation** — look for `segmented: true` in YAML. If missing, the transcript needs `##` section headers first. Either run `segment_transcript.py` or add headers manually.
4. **Check for existing vault sources** -- before declaring any referenced source inaccessible (paywalled, offline, video-only), search `_Clippings/` and `_Transcripts/` for existing copies. YouTube auto-transcripts, previously clipped articles, and federated documents are easy to overlook and may already be in the vault. In MMM S07, a DISI talk initially dismissed as "YouTube-only" was already in `_Clippings/` as a full transcript and turned out to be the most project-relevant source of the entire batch.
5. **Read the transcript** — understand the full content before extracting anything.
6. **Triage multi-topic sources** -- if the transcript covers multiple topics or threads, surface the topic list to the user and offer to skip stale or low-relevance items before writing. This keeps the harvest lean and avoids over-capturing content the user has already moved past. Especially valuable for chat-style transcripts and multi-meeting catch-up conversations where some threads may be outdated by harvest time.
7. **Harvest into destination docs** — synthesize relevant content into project documents. Use citation format: `([[NoteTitle#Section Header|YYYY-MM-DD — Section Name]])`. Don't transcribe — synthesize.
8. **Update source YAML** -- set `harvest_status`, `harvested_into` (with section-level anchors), `harvest_date`, and `harvest_notes`. For re-harvests, append to `harvested_into` and convert `harvest_date` to an array (most recent last). Or set `harvest_status: reviewed` with `harvest_notes` explaining why nothing was harvested.
9. **Update Harvest Ledger** -- add or update a row in `0.4 Harvest Ledger - [Project].md` with source, harvest date, destinations, and agent.
10. **Session log** -- add harvest details to `0.2 Session Log.md` at the end of the session as part of normal session logging -- not after each individual source.

## Segmentation (before you harvest)

Transcripts are the densest, highest-value content type in many vaults, but structurally noisy. Three properties make them distinct: topic shifts mid-stream (the raw transcript has no headers marking where topics change, so companion citations can't deep-link to specific moments), speaker-attributed ideas (who said something matters - preserve attribution, don't smooth it away), and high lexicon density (specialized language in its most authentic, unrehearsed form).

**Segment before extracting anything** (Workflow Step 3). Add `##` section headers at major topic shifts - without headers there are no anchor targets for deep-link citations.

Format:
```
## Section Name (@timestamp if available)
```

Good headers (specific, navigable):
- `## Threshold Design and Overflow Logic (@14:23)`
- `## Simon's Tension Around Ownership`
- `## Bonding Curves as Coordination Mechanism (@22:15)`

Bad headers (too generic):
- `## Discussion`
- `## Part 3`
- `## Continued`

Add headers on a first read-through, before extracting content. For very short transcripts (under ~1,000 words) headers may not be necessary - use judgment.

## Chunk and Route

1. **First pass: read the whole source** before routing anything.
2. **Second pass: identify chunks.** A chunk is a contiguous passage addressing one project topic. A single section may contain multiple chunks; one chunk may span multiple sections if they stay on one topic.
3. **Route each chunk to the most specific destination section** by title. When uncertain, read the first paragraph of a candidate section to confirm fit.
4. **Multi-topic chunks:** put primary content in the most specific section; add a brief cross-reference from the other. Don't duplicate full paragraphs.
5. **Draft all placements for human review** before writing anything to the vault.

## What Makes a Good Lexicon Candidate

When harvesting from transcripts, watch for a phrase or framing that:
- Is a specific phrase or framing, not a vague topic
- Says something in a distinctive way (not generic)
- Has a clear claim or idea embedded in it
- Could stand alone as a meme-seed with the right context

## Block-Level Citations (stamp-on-cite)

Section anchors (the `## Section Header` citations in Step 7) are the default. When a harvest claim points at a **specific transcript turn** rather than a whole section, cite the turn directly with a block ID:

- Stamp as you cite: use the block-stamper skill to give that turn an ID (reuse the existing one if present; otherwise the next unused `^tN`), then link to it. Don't pre-stamp the whole transcript -- stamping is the act of citing.
- Format: `([[TranscriptName#^t15|@22:15]])` -- the visible label is the **cited turn's own `@mm:ss`** timestamp. Use the `§` glyph as the label only when the turn has no derivable timestamp (an unsegmented or headerless transcript with no per-turn times). (Confirmed S236; supersedes the earlier section-header-derived rule.)
- Whole-section synthesis keeps the section-anchor form from Step 7.

Mechanic: block-stamper skill. Full format canon: [[Conventions Registry]].

Harvest destinations keep section anchors as their default *by design* - this differs from companions, which are block-default (D112, S232). See the Conventions Registry citation section for why the two regimes differ; it is the canonical statement, not a contradiction to resolve.

## Common Mistakes

- Harvesting without checking segmentation first -- citations can't deep-link without `##` headers
- Transcribing instead of synthesizing -- one idea per paragraph, don't reproduce the conversation
- Flattening tensions and disagreements -- preserve nuance
- Forgetting to update source YAML -- the next agent won't know this was already processed
- Skipping `harvest_notes` -- the "commit message" is the most valuable part, especially for `reviewed` or partial harvests
- Forgetting the Harvest Ledger -- source YAML is the truth, but the ledger is how humans and agents scan routing at a glance
- Harvesting without checking project assignment -- content ends up in the wrong project docs or gets orphaned
- Processing multiple sources without completing all 10 steps per source first (session log excepted -- that waits til end)
- Declaring a referenced source inaccessible without checking `_Clippings/` and `_Transcripts/` first -- existing vault copies are easy to overlook
- Using read-write-delete to relocate a transcript instead of `move_note` -- wastes tokens sending the entire body through the tool call for no content-level reason

## Note Relocation

When a transcript needs to move (e.g., from vault root to a project folder during harvest):

1. Use `move_note` to relocate the file -- this is atomic, zero-token, and preserves wikilinks.
2. Then use `update_frontmatter` or `patch_note` to add/update harvest metadata separately.

Never read-write-delete to move a note. Transcripts can be thousands of words long and the content doesn't change during a move. This rule applies to all note relocations, not just transcripts.

## Routing Patterns

### Research brief as harvest destination

When a transcript contains a researcher's verbal walkthrough of their work -- describing what documents they found, what's in a folder, what seems high leverage -- the harvest output can be the research brief the researcher didn't have time to write. This is especially common in collaborative projects where one person does research and another does synthesis.

The brief becomes a new file (not a patch to an existing doc) with: which documents were mentioned, which ones the researcher flagged as high leverage, and enough context for the next person or agent to know where to start. Tag with `priority: high` and `type: research-brief`.

Example: Weave Session 24 harvested a Kaliya-Andrew call where Kaliya walked through her Exploring Funding research. The harvest output was `Exploring Funding - Research Brief.md` -- the brief Andrew had asked her to write, assembled from her verbal tour.

This pattern applies when: (a) the transcript is someone describing research they've done, (b) no written brief exists yet, (c) the research is in a folder or set of documents that others need to navigate. The brief is a harvest destination alongside the usual synth docs.

## Document Structure Lock

When harvest output requires creating a substantial new document (reconciliation paper, research overview, multi-section analysis, research brief), lock the file structure with the user before writing begins. Use AskUserQuestion (if available) or ask in prose. Key decisions to lock:

- **Document type and posture** -- research brief vs. synthesis doc vs. design doc? Descriptive vs. prescriptive vs. exploratory?
- **Section structure** -- what sections does the user expect? Flat or nested? How granular?
- **Audience** -- is this for the operator, the team, or external readers?
- **Scope ceiling** -- what's explicitly out of scope? Where should you stop?

This applies to new file creation only. Patching existing docs with harvest extracts doesn't need a structure lock -- the structure already exists.

Rationale: document structure, posture, and scope ceiling are expensive to reverse after writing. Locking them upfront with explicit choices prevents rework. (Source: WV-S86 via FR)

## Batch Mode

When processing large transcript batches (total word count exceeding ~50k words, typically 15+ sources), single-agent sequential processing exceeds context capacity and degrades quality. Use parallel subagent extraction instead.

**When to use batch mode:**
- Total word count of routed transcripts exceeds ~50k words
- More than ~10 transcripts need harvesting in one session
- Sources are long-form (conference panels, multi-hour meetings, lecture series)

**Setup:**
- Divide sources into subsets of ~3 files each
- Each subagent receives: its file subset, the project's Content Interests, exact citation format requirements (`[[NoteTitle#Section Header|YYYY-MM-DD -- Section Name]]`), and the list of destination documents
- Subagents run in parallel, each completing Steps 1-9 for their files

**Coordination:**
- A coordinator agent merges results across subagents and deduplicates cross-references
- Citation anchors (section headers, timestamps) must be preserved through the merge -- verify anchors resolve after merge
- The coordinator handles Step 10 (session log) for the full batch

**Validated:** WV-S91 (Katapult batch, 15 transcripts, 5 parallel agents, ~3 files each). Parallel extraction preserved citation fidelity and produced higher-quality extracts than sequential processing under context pressure.

## Principles

- Treat each source as one atomic unit -- complete steps 1-9 before the next source (step 10 waits til session end)
- Synthesize, don't transcribe. One idea per paragraph.
- Preserve tensions and disagreements -- don't flatten nuance.
- Include speaker attribution where relevant.
- Extract `lexicon_candidates` if the transcript contains novel language or framings.
