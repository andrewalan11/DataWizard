Explicit anti-patterns. If you catch yourself doing any of these, stop.

**Don't put private content in shared folders.** Private meeting notes, personal reflections, and confidential materials stay in private folders. Only transcripts and documents explicitly cleared for sharing go in shared project folders.

**Don't duplicate content across documents.** Content lives in one place. If the same material is relevant to two documents, put it in the most specific home and cross-reference from the other with a wikilink.

**Don't modify archived originals.** Files marked as originals, archives, or source copies should never be edited. Work from copies or companion notes.

**Don't change filenames that other notes link to.** Obsidian resolves wikilinks by filename. Renaming a file that's linked from other notes breaks those links. If a rename is needed, use Obsidian's built-in rename (which updates links) or flag it for the human.

**Don't add empty YAML fields as placeholders.** Absence of a field is meaningful - it means "not yet processed." Adding `harvest_status:` with no value, or `type:` with no value, creates ambiguity. Either set a real value or leave the field off entirely.

**Don't process files outside your scope.** Each project has boundaries. Don't modify files in other project folders unless explicitly instructed. If you find content that belongs elsewhere, flag it - don't move it yourself.

**Don't assume your context is current.** If the session log shows recent activity by another agent, re-read affected files before editing. Stale reads lead to overwrites.

**Don't write to a shared document from two agents at once.** When multiple instances might touch the same file, coordinate through the human (or claim it via a session-log stub) rather than writing simultaneously - concurrent writes clobber each other. The S178/S179 stub collision is the cautionary case.

**Don't re-run expensive operations without checking.** Before running LLM classification or enrichment on a file, check its YAML first. If it already has a valid `type:` or `harvest_status:`, it may not need reprocessing.

**Don't rewrite massive files when you only need to edit a section.** If a file is too large for surgical edits via patch, check with the user about chunking it into shell + sections first. Full-file rewrites of large documents risk accidentally dropping content.

**Don't use the retired `!` filename prefix.** Prefixing note filenames with `!` to force sort order was retired (S116 / PI v4.0). Use the `0.x` infrastructure slots or a plain descriptive title - see the [[Conventions Registry]] file-naming rule.

*Extracted from the DataWizard Universal Protocol (section 12.0) in the S182 demolition (D94). Structural conventions live in the [[Conventions Registry]].*
