# Content Type Taxonomy v2.7

> The canonical reference for all YAML `type:` values. Used by the enrichment pipeline classifier, review queues, and human editors. Machine-readable canon: `Seed/Config/taxonomy.yaml` (type validity, fold map, instance overlay mechanism) -- scripts consume the YAML; this doc carries the prose signals and decision tree.

---

## YAML Conventions

- Always lowercase key: `type:` (not `Type:`)
- Values are lowercase with hyphens: `meeting-note`, `video-transcript`, `seedpod`
- Single value only — no comma-separated types
- All pipeline outputs referencing vault notes use `[[wikilinks]]`
- New `type:` values are admitted to `taxonomy.yaml` (or the instance overlay) BEFORE use. Skill output templates that stamp `type:` are the observed drift surface: one template line minted 106 files of an undesigned type before lint caught it (S179). When writing or reviewing a skill that creates files, check its template's `type:` against the taxonomy.

## Active Types (19)

---

### article
Prose content — essays, blog posts, reports, opinion pieces, speculative fiction, academic writing.

**Signals**: Narrative paragraphs, byline/author, publication date, no product/service offerings.

---

### entity
Organization, company, collective, project, or initiative homepage. **Persistent** — not time-bounded. Distinguish from `event` (which has specific dates). A core org record (one project-agnostic note per entity, with `entity_kind` and `core_id`) is also `entity` - see YAML Schema, "Holonic Core Records".

**Signals**: "About us" language, mission statement, team listings, programs/services, calls to action (join, donate, partner). No specific event dates.

---

### event
A clipped event listing page — gathering, conference, festival, or convergence with specific dates, location, and program. Would otherwise be misclassified as `entity`. **Time-bounded**.

**Signals**: URL + specific dates + physical location + agenda, lineup, or speaker list. Ticket/registration links common.
**YAML additions**: `event_date:`, `event_location:`.

---

### person
Individual's personal page, LinkedIn profile, bio, portfolio.

**Signals**: First-person or biographical language, headshot, role/title, personal projects.

---

### document
A purposefully constructed working doc — proposals, pitches, strategy docs, plans. Authorship is a signal but not the definition: a proposal written *about* your project by someone else still qualifies.

**Signals**: Constructed toward a specific goal or audience. No publication intent. Project-specific. Not reference material (that's `resource`). Not published prose (that's `article`).

---

### video-transcript
Transcript of a public video — YouTube, Vimeo, or similar. Raw captions, pre-processed bullet points, or manual notes from a recording. **Public/published content**.

**Signals**: YouTube/Vimeo URL in source, timestamps, speaker labels, conversational or lecture structure.

*(Replaces `transcript` — retired in v2.5)*

---

### podcast-transcript
Transcript of a published podcast episode. Distinct from `video-transcript`: guest/host dynamic, episode metadata (show name, number), RSS/podcast URL.

**Signals**: Podcast or RSS URL, show + episode structure, host introducing a guest, multi-speaker dialogue with clear interviewer role.
**YAML additions**: `show:`, `episode:` fields recommended.

---

### meeting-transcript
Raw transcript from a personal meeting (via Fathom or similar). **Private** — your conversations with your network.

**Signals**: Fathom URL, speaker labels with email addresses, personal conversational tone, action items.

---

### voice-memo-transcript
Transcript of a personal voice memo, transcribed via Whisper. Single speaker. Often has transcription artifacts from noisy/unclear source audio.

**Signals**: No URL, no speaker labels (or just one speaker), informal/stream-of-consciousness structure, possible Whisper transcription artifacts.

*(Replaces `voice-memo` — retired in v2.5)*

---

### meeting-note
Your personal notes taken during or after a meeting. Distinct from `meeting-transcript` (raw Fathom output).

**Signals**: Date-prefixed filenames, informal bullet points, personal observations, no Fathom URL or speaker email labels.

---

### seedpod
Multi-idea personal notes — longer than a `seed`, not formal content. Multiple distinct ideas in one note, separated by line breaks. Covers: gathering notes, video watch notes with timecodes, multi-idea scratchpads, brainstorm dumps.

**Delineation from `seed`**: A seed is 1–3 lines, one idea. A seedpod has multiple ideas with line breaks between them.
**Signals**: No URL (or URL is incidental), multiple distinct ideas, personal/informal tone, line breaks between ideas, may have timecodes or loose structure.
**Enrichment**: Tags and themes only. No companion note.

*(Replaces `event-capture` — retired in v2.5)*

---

### seed
A raw idea, observation, question, or fragment captured quickly. Proto-content — title often *is* the content.

**Signals**: Short content (1–3 lines, < 300 chars body, or empty), no URL/source field, reads like a thought, question, or observation.
**Enrichment**: Tags and themes in YAML only. No companion note. Too short for summarization.

---

### garden
A synthesis note that clusters related seeds and seedpods into a coherent project concept. Gardens are the intermediate stage between raw seeds and full DW-bootstrapped projects: they gather scattered ideas, synthesize what they're saying together, map allies and existing efforts, and track maturity toward becoming a project.

**Signals**: Links to multiple seeds/seedpods, synthesis narrative, `stage:` field in YAML, lives in a project folder or `_Gardens/`.
**YAML additions**: `stage:`, `gardeners:`.
**Enrichment**: Not enriched by the standard pipeline -- gardens ARE a synthesis output.

*(Admitted v2.7 per D89; validated S140/S159)*

---

### resource
Reference material, frameworks, foundational documents, methodology docs.

**Signals**: Informational/educational tone, framework descriptions, not time-bound, not project-specific.

---

### resource-list
A curated collection of links to other resources.

**Signals**: Dominated by URLs/links, list structure, minimal prose per item.

---

### multi-part
One chapter/section of a larger work.

**Signals**: Numbered titles, shared source URL domain, shared author, sequential content.
**YAML additions**: `series:` field linking to parent series note, `chapter:` number.

---

### video
A video page — YouTube, Vimeo, or other platform. The source note contains the clipped page (title, description, metadata). If a transcript is available via yt-dlp, it is appended to the same note body.

**Signals**: YouTube/Vimeo URL in source, video embed, any content length.
**YAML additions**: `has_transcript: true | false`, `transcript_date:` (when extraction ran).

**Enrichment behavior**:
- `has_transcript: true` → full enrichment (overview summary, detailed summary, speakers, key topics, themes, tags, lexicon candidates)
- `has_transcript: false` → lighter enrichment from description only (overview summary, key topics, themes, tags)

**Classifier rule**: Any note with a YouTube or Vimeo URL → `video`, always. No LLM needed.

---

### companion
AI-generated summary/enrichment of a source note. Created by the enrichment pipeline. Always has a `source:` field pointing to the original note.

**Signals**: `source:` field in YAML, lives in `_Companions/`, title prefixed with `c_`.

**Not enriched further** — these ARE the enrichment output. The pipeline reads these to avoid re-processing.

---

### message
An asynchronous communication — voice note, audio message, or text message sent to or received from someone. Distinct from `voice-memo-transcript` (to yourself) and `meeting-note`/`meeting-transcript` (live conversations).

**Signals**: Directed at a specific person, conversational but one-directional, often transcribed from audio message (WhatsApp, iMessage voice note), may contain links or references shared between people.

## Retired Types

| Old Type | Replacement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `concept` | `tags: [concept]` | Proto-lexicon entries, now a tag not a type |
| `capture` | `seedpod` | Renamed to event-capture, then to seedpod |
| `reference` | `resource` | Renamed for clarity |
| `meeting` | `meeting-note` | Renamed; split from `meeting-transcript` |
| `summary` / `AIsummary` | `companion` | For AI summaries of source notes |
| `AI` / `AI_generated` | tag: `ai-generated` | Consolidated, then retired as type entirely |
| `AI-written` | tag: `ai-generated` | AI authorship is metadata, not a content type |
| `transcript` | `video-transcript` | Renamed for explicit *-transcript family convention |
| `voice-memo` | `voice-memo-transcript` | Renamed for explicit *-transcript family convention |
| `event-capture` | `seedpod` | Renamed — broader concept than events |
| `corpus-source` | `companion` | Never designed; was a corpus-enrichment skill template slip. Corpus mode is marked by `corpus_context:`, not type (S179) |
