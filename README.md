## What Is DataWizard?

DataWizard is a set of prompts and a few scripts that teach your AI assistant how to work in your Obsidian vault -- and how to leave breadcrumbs so that you and future conversations can find your way back through the vault to the source.

The problem: every new AI conversation starts with a blank slate. DataWizard solves this by giving the AI a structured place to read and write -- your vault -- and teaching it to leave a trail. Session logs, metadata, structured notes, project files. Every conversation adds to the trail, and every new conversation reads it to pick up where the last one left off.

What it does: classifies notes by content type, enriches them with tags and metadata, processes transcripts into searchable notes, routes content to the right projects, manages multi-project infrastructure, and saves everything with one keystroke.

It's not a product or an app. It's just well-organized markdown files and a playbook that teaches the AI how to use them. Local-first, open source, and designed primarily for Claude but compatible with any AI that supports MCP.

## Before You Start

Here's what we're going to do, step by step:

1. **Install Obsidian** -- the app where your notes live
2. **Create a vault** -- a folder on your computer for your notes
3. **Install the DataWizard Seed** -- protocols and skills that teach Claude how to work in your vault
4. **Install Node.js** -- a runtime that powers the connection between Claude and Obsidian
5. **Connect Claude to your vault** -- so Claude can read and write your notes
6. **Finish setup with Claude** -- Claude will verify the connection, set up your project, and walk you through the rest

Steps 1-6 happen in this guide. Step 7 happens in a conversation with Claude after the connection is live.

**You don't need any coding, terminal, or git experience.** Every step below is copy-and-paste, and Claude handles the technical parts for you. If you *are* comfortable with the command line or git, feel free to adapt these steps -- nothing here requires doing it exactly this way.

---

## Step 1: Install Obsidian

Download Obsidian from https://obsidian.md (free) and install it.

---

## Step 2: Create a Vault

Open Obsidian. It will ask you to create or open a vault. Create a new vault.

**Important: choose a local folder on your computer.** Do not put your vault in a cloud-synced folder (Dropbox, iCloud, Nextcloud, OneDrive, Google Drive). Cloud sync services can interfere with Obsidian's file indexing and cause files created outside Obsidian to not appear. Use a regular local folder -- for example, `/Users/yourname/My Vault` or `/Users/yourname/Documents/My Vault`.

If you want cloud backup, just ask Claude to set it up when you're ready -- it handles everything for you. (DataWizard uses git under the hood, which saves changes more reliably than continuous file sync. You don't need to know git to benefit from it; if you already do, you're welcome to set up backup your own way.)

---

## Step 3: Find Your Vault Path

You'll need the full path to your vault folder for the next steps. Here's how to find it:

1. Open **Finder**
2. Navigate to your vault folder
3. Press **Cmd + Option + C** -- this copies the full path to your clipboard

The path will look something like: `/Users/yourname/My Vault`

Paste it somewhere you can grab it easily (a note, a text file, or just keep it on your clipboard). You'll need it twice: once to install the Seed, and once to connect Claude.

---

## Step 4: Install the DataWizard Seed

The Seed is the core of DataWizard -- protocols, skills, and guides that teach Claude how to operate in your vault. It lives locally inside your vault so Claude can read it directly.

Open **Terminal** (press Cmd + Space, type "Terminal", hit Enter). A window will appear with a blinking cursor.

Paste this command, replacing `/Users/yourname/My Vault` with your actual vault path from Step 3:

```bash
cd "/Users/yourname/My Vault" && \
curl -sL https://github.com/andrewalan11/DataWizard/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o /tmp/dw-seed.zip && \
unzip -qo /tmp/dw-seed.zip -d /tmp/dw-seed && \
mkdir -p _DataWizard/Seed && \
cp -R /tmp/dw-seed/DataWizard-main/. _DataWizard/Seed/ && \
rm -rf /tmp/dw-seed /tmp/dw-seed.zip && \
echo "DataWizard Seed installed to _DataWizard/Seed/"
```

You should see "DataWizard Seed installed to _DataWizard/Seed/" in Terminal.

**Note:** The `_DataWizard` folder won't appear in Obsidian's sidebar -- this is expected. Obsidian hides folders that start with an underscore. Claude can still read it fine through the connection we'll set up next.

---

## Step 5: Install Node.js

Node.js powers the `mcp-remote` bridge that connects Claude Desktop to the Local REST API plugin (Step 6). Check if you already have it by running this in Terminal:

```bash
node --version
```

If you see a version number (like `v20.11.0`), you're good -- skip to Step 6.

If you see "command not found," install it:

**First, check for Homebrew:**

```bash
brew --version
```

If "command not found," install Homebrew first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

It will ask for your Mac password. When you type, nothing appears on screen -- that's normal. Just type your password and press Enter.

**Important:** After Homebrew installs, it shows "Next steps" commands at the bottom. You must run those commands. They look like:

```bash
echo >> /Users/YOURUSERNAME/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/YOURUSERNAME/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

**Then install Node.js:**

```bash
brew install node
```

Verify it worked:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see a version number.

---

## Step 6: Connect Claude to Your Vault

Claude reaches your vault through the **Local REST API & MCP Server** Obsidian plugin, which exposes your vault over both a REST API and a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Your LLM client connects to that MCP server.

> This replaces the older `@bitbonsai/mcpvault` method and any separate "MCP server + REST API plugin" combo -- the Local REST API plugin now provides both in one.

### 6a. Install the Local REST API & MCP Server plugin

1. In Obsidian: **Settings -> Community plugins -> Browse**
2. Search for **Local REST API & MCP Server** (by *coddingtonbear*), then **Install -> Enable**
3. Open **Settings -> Local REST API & MCP Server** and **copy your API Key** -- you'll need it below
4. Note the ports it shows: **27123 (HTTP)** and **27124 (HTTPS)**. The HTTPS cert is self-signed and many Operating Systems reject it, so these instructions use the **HTTP** port `27123` on localhost (safe, since it never leaves your machine).

### 6b. Connect Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop talks to the plugin through the `mcp-remote` bridge (this is why Node.js was installed in Step 5). Paste this into Terminal, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key from step 6a:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

mkdir -p "$(dirname "$CONFIG_FILE")"
if [ ! -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ] || [ ! -s "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then echo "{}" > "$CONFIG_FILE"; fi

node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('$CONFIG_FILE', 'utf8'));
if (!config.mcpServers) config.mcpServers = {};
config.mcpServers.obsidian = {
  command: 'npx',
  args: [
    'mcp-remote@latest',
    'http://127.0.0.1:27123/mcp/',
    '--header',
    'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY'
  ]
};
fs.writeFileSync('$CONFIG_FILE', JSON.stringify(config, null, 2));
console.log('Done! Obsidian MCP added to Claude Desktop config.');
"
```

Then **Quit and reopen Claude Desktop** (Obsidian menu -> Quit, don't just close the window), and verify under **Settings -> Developer** that **obsidian** shows as running/green.

**Tip:** Obsidian must be running for the connection to work -- the Local REST API server only runs while Obsidian is open.

### 6c. Connect a different LLM / MCP client

*Most people connect Claude Desktop (6b) and can skip this section -- it's here for those who want to use a different MCP-capable client.*

Any MCP-capable client connects to the same endpoint. Two patterns:

- **Stdio clients (most desktop apps, e.g. Claude Desktop):** run the bridge
  `npx mcp-remote@latest http://127.0.0.1:27123/mcp/ --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"`
- **Clients that support remote HTTP MCP directly:** point them at `http://127.0.0.1:27123/mcp/` and send header `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (use the `27124` HTTPS URL only if your client accepts the self-signed cert).

> **Prefer chatting inside Obsidian?** The **Claude Sidebar** and **Claudian** community plugins embed Claude Code in a side panel. They use the vault directly and do **not** need this Local REST API / MCP setup -- a separate path from the Claude Desktop method above.

---

## Step 7: Finish Setup with Claude

The connection is live. Now Claude can do the rest.

Open a new conversation in Claude Desktop and say:

> **"Set up DataWizard"**

Claude will walk you through the rest of the setup interactively:
- Verify that every tool in the connection works correctly
- Help you create a Claude Project with DataWizard instructions
- Explain how to keep things in sync and collaborate with others
- Offer to set up automatic backup and collaboration for you (no git knowledge needed)

This is the last step. After this, you're up and running.

---

## Updating

Seed updates are user-initiated -- orientation checks your local Seed's VERSION.md but does not contact GitHub. To update at any time:

```bash
bash _DataWizard/Seed/update_seed.sh
```

This downloads the latest Seed and overwrites only the Seed files. Your project content (session logs, action items, workshop docs) is never touched.

---

## What's in the Seed

```
_DataWizard/Seed/
  README.md              - This file
  VERSION.md             - Version numbers and update instructions
  DataWizard Project Instructions.md - Instructions to paste into Claude (or @import for Claude Code)
  update_seed.sh         - Install/update script
  SKILLS.md              - Skills catalog (the authoritative list of all skills)
  Protocols/             - Operating rules: Conventions Registry, YAML Schema, Editorial Principles, Anti-Patterns, Content Type Taxonomy, Quest Lifecycle
  Skills/                - One folder per skill; SKILLS.md is the catalog
  Agents/                - Agent instruction files
  Scripts/               - Classification, segmentation, routing, sync, and converter scripts
  Config/                - Default configuration (enrichment_defaults.yaml)
  Guides/                - Setup and reference guides (Git Guide, Vault Structure Guide, Filename Safety, Federation Guide, Seed Install and Update, MCP Reliability, Cowork Scheduled Tasks, and more)
```

One file you may see referenced that is NOT in the shipped Seed: `Vault Config.md` (user-specific paths and settings). It is deliberately kept out of the shared Seed so each vault keeps its own. (For the technically inclined: it's listed in `.gitignore`.) If a guide or skill asks for it and it doesn't exist yet, create it at `_DataWizard/Seed/Vault Config.md` with the paths it asks about.

---

## For AI Agents

If a user shares this README or the GitHub link with you, help them get DataWizard set up. Follow the steps above.

Key points:
- The Seed should be installed locally in the vault, not read from GitHub
- All protocols, skills, and guides are in `_DataWizard/Seed/` -- read them via MCP
- Orientation reads the local Seed's VERSION.md only -- no GitHub fetch. Updates run via update_seed.sh when the user asks
- Always get user approval before writing to the vault
- If the user already has a Seed installed, check if it needs updating before starting
- After MCP is connected, load the `install-wizard` skill to complete setup interactively
- MCP connection uses the **Local REST API** Obsidian plugin (by coddingtonbear), which exposes the vault's MCP server; clients bridge to it via `mcp-remote` (see Step 6). This replaces the older `@bitbonsai/mcpvault` package.

## Troubleshooting

**"No servers added" in Developer settings:**
Check that the config command ran without errors. Open the config file to verify it looks correct:
```bash
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```
You should see an `mcpServers` section with an `obsidian` entry running `mcp-remote` against `http://127.0.0.1:27123/mcp/`. If not, run the Step 6 command again. Then Force Quit Claude Desktop (not just Cmd+Q) and reopen.

**MCP server shows red / not connecting:**
Run `node --version` and `npx --version` in Terminal to verify they work. Then check the Obsidian side: the **Local REST API** plugin is installed and enabled, Obsidian is running, and the API key in your config matches the one in **Settings -> Local REST API**. Confirm you're using the HTTP URL `http://127.0.0.1:27123/mcp/` (the HTTPS port `27124` uses a self-signed cert that many clients reject).

**Authentication / 401 errors:**
The API key in your Claude config doesn't match the plugin. Copy a fresh key from **Settings -> Local REST API**, re-run the Step 6 command with it, then Force Quit and reopen Claude Desktop.

**Tools disappear mid-conversation:**
Start a new conversation. Check that Obsidian is still running and the server shows green in Settings - Developer.

**Seed install shows errors:**
Run the install command from Step 4 again. If it persists, download the ZIP manually from https://github.com/andrewalan11/DataWizard and unzip into `_DataWizard/Seed/`.

**Config file already had content and something broke:**
The Step 6 command merges safely with existing config content. But if something went wrong, you can view your current config with:
```bash
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```
Check that the JSON is valid (matching braces, no trailing commas). You can paste it into https://jsonlint.com to verify. If it's broken, the simplest fix is to restore from a backup or rebuild it manually.
